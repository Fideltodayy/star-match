## Technical tools
I used various technical tools to deliver this application's features:
* I needed to use browser history so a user can use the back button to navigate back to the previous page and also to create deep links to a specific house. Here is where [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) comes in.
Now links to houses can be shared using the likes of social media.

* I practiced [creating custom hooks](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/hooks-custom.html) to enhance separation of concerns and make my code cleaner by components focusing on rendering jsx. Custom hooks also helped in availing the hooks to other components and not restricting it to only one component.

* I used [CONTEXT API](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/context.html) to share data efficciently accross my components
